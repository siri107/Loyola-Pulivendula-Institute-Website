    "loyola-history": "St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus, was born in 1491 as the youngest child of a large Basque family in Spain. The name Loyola comes from the ancestral castle that was the family's heritage. Trained for arms and courtly etiquette, Ignatius enlisted in the border wars with France, where he was badly wounded in battle. During his recovery at Loyola, he read the Gospel narratives and the lives of Saints, which inspired him to abandon worldly ambitions and embrace a life of poverty, sacrifice, and service, following the example of his saintly mentors. He began this new life at the age of 31, spending a year of severe penance and intense prayer in a solitary cave near Manresa, by the river Cardoner. Ignatius recorded his spiritual experiences in a book called 'The Spiritual Exercises,' which became the foundation of Jesuit spirituality. Reflecting on the crisis in the church of his time, he recognized the need for learned and holy priests who were free from greed and ambition and ready to serve the poor, witnessing Christ's love for humanity. To achieve this, he set himself on a path of study, progressing from grammar school to university, ultimately earning his Master's Degree from the Sorbonne in Paris. During this time, he gathered a group of brilliant university men, including St. Francis Xavier, whom he molded through the Spiritual Exercises. Together, they formed the Society of Jesus, or the Jesuits, dedicated to service, education, and the mission of Christ."
